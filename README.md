nginx-ssl-auto automates SSL certificate setup for NGINX using Let's Encrypt (Certbot). This tool helps you quickly configure HTTPS reverse proxies with minimal effort. It simplifies the process, allowing you to focus more on your project and less on security configurations.

## üöÄ Getting Started
Setting up your SSL certificate can be confusing. This guide will walk you through downloading and running the application.

### ‚úÖ System Requirements
To run nginx-ssl-auto, you will need the following:

- A computer or server that can run NGINX.
- An internet connection to obtain SSL certificates.
- Basic access to your server, which may require SSH access.

## üîë Configuration
After installation, follow these steps to configure your SSL certificates:

1. **Open a Command Line Terminal**  
   Access your command line interface (for example, Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS, or Shell on Linux).

2. **Navigate to the Installation Directory**  
   Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you installed nginx-ssl-auto.

3. **Start the Configuration Process**  
   Type the command `python3 nginx_ssl_auto.py` and press Enter. This will launch the script.

4. **Follow On-Screen Prompts**  
   The application will guide you through the necessary steps. You will need to provide some information, such as your domain names and email address.

5. **Complete Configuration**  
   Once the process finishes, nginx-ssl-auto will automatically set up the SSL certificates and configure NGINX.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Usage
After the setup, you can use nginx-ssl-auto anytime you need to renew your certificates or configure new domains. Simply follow the same command-line steps without needing to re-install the software.

### üîÑ Renewing SSL Certificates
NGINX SSL certificates typically need renewal every 60-90 days. To renew, just run the command from the installation directory again. The application handles the renewal process automatically.

## üì° Support and Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, consider the following steps:

- **Check Your Internet Connection**  
Make sure that your server has internet access. Issues with connectivity can prevent certificate issuance.
